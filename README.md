## What is this?

Easy way showing SkiaSharp-based image objects onto WPF applications.

`SKImageView` is a control of SkiaSharp image drawing.
You can manipulate same as with WPF's `Image` control.

Available properties:

|Name|Detail|
|:----|:----|
|`Source`|SkiaSharp image related objects. See listed below.|
|`Stretch`|[Stretch enum value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.stretch?view=windowsdesktop-6.0), TODO: currently `None` and `Uniform` are accepted. |
|`StretchDirection`|TODO: [StretchDirection enum value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.controls.stretchdirection?view=windowsdesktop-6.0)|

The `Source` property accepts the following types of objects:

|Type|Aspect ratio from|
|:----|:----|
|`SKBitmap`|Origin|
|`SKImage`|Origin|
|`SKPicture`|Measured `RenderSize`|
|`SKDrawable`|Measured `RenderSize`|
|`SKSurface`|Measured `RenderSize`|

Some types are drawn with aspect ratio corresponding to the current measured `RenderSize` area.
Therefore, to maintain the aspect ratio, the size must be explicitly controlled in XAML.

XAML example:

```xml
<Window xmlns:siv="https://github.com/kekyo/SkiaImageView.Wpf">
    <siv:SKImageView
        Stretch="Uniform"
        Source="{Binding PreviewImage}" />
</Window>
```
